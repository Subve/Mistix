# Mistix
 


Deleting the previous project coz of it's advanced type.

Mistix_The_Right_One is the the right project.



Buying upgrades with the right mouse button
Shooting with the left mouse button
Move your character with W,S,A,D

The zombie can evolve- if they meet each other they are healing a little.

Barricades are spawning time to time, they can stop zombie for a while
Apples can heal you up.

Your best score will saved.

You can set the volume and difficulty in the setting options.

I used the graphics on "depositphotos.com", the graphics belong to this page.
 I only used it for the needs of the project, 
it will not be distributed for commercial purposes.

The rest of resources is "royalty free".


The zombie evolution sometimes bug, just keep running away and shooting(making circles with your character often help)
your score will be updated after a short while.
